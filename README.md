**⚠️  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ⚠️ **

This is a **quick and dirty `Go` hack** used to explore text embeddings generated for lyrics of the songs made by [Taylor Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift) and [Masterplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterplan_(band)).

You can read more about the motivation for it and much more [here](http://localhost:1313/2024/01/07/fun-with-embeddings/).
